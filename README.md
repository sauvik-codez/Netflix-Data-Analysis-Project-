# 📺 Netflix Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset** to uncover insights about content distribution, trends, and patterns across genres, release years, and countries. The analysis is performed in **Python** using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on Netflix’s catalog to understand:

* The type and volume of content available on the platform
* How movies and TV shows are distributed by country, genre, and release year
* Popular content categories and patterns over time
* Data-driven insights that could help understand Netflix’s content strategy
